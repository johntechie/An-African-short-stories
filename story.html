		           <h2 align="center" ><i>Why</I></h2>
	               <p>
				      <i>WHY</i> is April the cruellest month, breeding Licas out of the dead land, mixing memory & desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.
					  <i>WHY</i> does winter keeps us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding a little life with dried tubers. whereas summer keeps on supprising us,
					  coming over the hills of Aberderse with shower of rain, some miles away, sunlight is overwhelming in the busking city of nairobi.
					  <br />
              		  On the beautifull Kilimanjaro mountain, <i>WHY</i> are the roots clutched, the branches grow out of the stoney terrain, it gives no shelter to the trees, the cricket no relief, and the dried stones no sound of water. indeed it does not care!
	               </p>
	                 
                    <p>You stand shoulder strong with you children, never giving up on them during there breaking point, they say that you are dark nation but beneath you know you heart is as bright as day light. <br />
                       Unite your people, is all i ask of you, cause devision will surely bring shame upon you name. <br />
					   
					   <i>WHY</i> is is tribalism, corruption reigning upon your people as it is need less to say its a time bomb waiting to explore, You are wealthy in food and resources yet you children are starving to death, Should i blame it on your luck of equal distribution of your resource or for bringing up greedy children who's top priority is to grab all give non.
                    </P>
					
					<p> Bottomline, after darkness theres light, after storm theirs sunlight and in your deep hash terrain, cruel weather conditions, corrupt and immoral children <b>THERES HOPE!</b> and for we cannot say or guess, for you know only <br />
					</P>
					
					<p>Regards <br /> 
					<b><i>I</i></b>
					</P>
